    This module exports recognize_entities(), a function which
    adds a named entity recognition layer on top of the reynir.bintokenizer
    functionality.

    Named entity recognition requires access to the SQL scraper database
    and is thus not appropriate for inclusion in reynir.bintokenizer,
    as ReynirPackage does not (and should not) require a database to be present.
